* This is a repository that I used to record my progress and thoughts during LeetCode coding (using Java & Python mainly, sometimes use C).
* I may post more than one solution for an exercise, along with detailed comparision.
* If you find any errors or have better ideas for certain solutions, your directions are always welcome!
