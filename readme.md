* This is a repository that I used to record my progress and thoughts during LeetCode coding (mainly use Java & Python, may use C sometimes).
* I may post more than one solution/algorithm for a given exercise, along with detailed comparison.
* If you find any errors or have better ideas for certain solutions, your directions are always welcome!
